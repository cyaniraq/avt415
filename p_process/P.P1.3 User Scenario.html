			<dd>Rebecca is currently enrolled in university and is only taking 2 classes. After completing 3 weeksâ€™ worth of school, she realizes she has a lot of free time to do whatever she wants despite working at the same time. She browses through the internet to find a new hobby that she can pursue. She comes across multiple websites offering ceramics, paints, and sports-related materials. She then comes across a website known for its puzzles. She browses to find that the puzzles are not only made of paper, but of other materials such as metallic. She decides to buy a metallic puzzle as a long-term project.
